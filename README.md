# Algorithms and Data Structures

Coding project for The Odin Project in which we were required to learn several algorithms and data structures. This is my attempt at tackling this task. In the source code I have included:

# Merge Sort Algorithm

Follows the divide and conquer strategy by breaking down the task of sorting an array into smaller subtasks using recursion.

# Linked Lists

A type of linear data structure that stores data in nodes. Each node contains the data value and a pointer that points to the next node or null. To traverse a linked list you must go from one node to the next one at a time in the direction that is indicated. 

# Hash Maps/Tables 

A type of data structure that uses hashing to store data (in buckets). A hash function can take a key and convert it into a hash code which can be used to retrieve or store the value. Each key can only be paired with one value or else this is called collisions which should be minimized. 

# Binary Search Tree

 A type of data structure that allows for the fast lookup, insertion, and removal of items. Each node has a data value and a left and right child that stems from it.
